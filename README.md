seradio-manual ([asciidoc](http://asciidoctor.org) fork)
=============================================================

This repo contains the host training manual for the Software Engineering Radio.  We use it on the podcast to train new hosts and to keep track of best practices.  The host manual is licensed under creative commons 2.5. 

The repo currently contains the manual in three formats:
 - MS Word
 - PDF
 - asciidoc (this is the eastiest one to submit small changes) 

We are interested in translations if anyone would like to contribute.
